OXID eShop "Basic" theme for shopversions > 4.7
====================
Formerly within standard delivered theme "Basic" from OXID eShop is not supported any more since version 4.7.0 on. 
If you have an individual child theme based on "Basic" and want to use it in newer eShop versions, you need to have the "Basic" theme as parent.
 
 Installation:
====================
 + Copy the content of "copy_this" into your shop root
 + execute "install.sql" in eShop admin below Service -> Tools 
 + activate theme in admin -> Extensions -> Themes
